    "lyrics": "I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night\nRough on the surface but you cut through like a knife\nAnd if it was an open-shut case\nI never would've known from that look on your face\nLost in your current like a priceless wine\nThe more that you say\nThe less I know\nWherever you stray\nI follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nHead on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in\nAs if you were a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd there was one prize I'd cheat to win\nThe more that you say\nThe less I know\nWherever you stray\nI follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nThey count me out time and time again\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)\nBut I come back stronger than a 90's trend\nWait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut case\nGuess I should've known from the look on your face\nEvery bait and switch was a work of art\nThe more that you say\nThe less I know\nWherever you stray\nI follow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nThe more that you say\nThe less I know\nWherever you stray\nI follow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man\nHey, that's my man\nThat's my man\nYeah, that's my man\nEvery bait and switch was a work of art\nThat's my man\nHey, that's my man\nI'm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans\nThat's my man",
